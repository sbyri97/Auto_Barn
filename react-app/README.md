This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The React part of the application lives here.  While is development, run this application from this location using `npm start`.


No environment variables are needed to run this application in development, but be sure to set the REACT_APP_BASE_URL environment variable in heroku!
